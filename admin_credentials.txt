RECENT FIXES (November 5, 2025):
-------------------------------
✅ Fixed SQLAlchemy column comparison issues in authentication
✅ Fixed admin endpoint authorization checks  
✅ Updated database schema to include phone field
✅ Fixed doctor/nurse creation schema mismatches
✅ Auto-generated default passwords for staff:
   - Doctors: "doctor123"
   - Nurses: "nurse123"
✅ Fixed delete operations for doctors and nurses
✅ FINAL FIX: Fixed token storage mismatch in StaffManagement component
   - Was looking for 'token' but auth stored in 'vitalsfirst_auth'
   - Now correctly retrieves token from proper localStorage location

TESTING COMPLETED:
-----------------
✅ Login endpoint: Working (returns valid JWT token)
✅ Admin doctors endpoint: Working (returns 200 OK)
✅ Authentication flow: Fully functional
✅ Staff management should now work completely!

---------------
1. Make sure backend server is running on port 8000:
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

2. Make sure frontend is running on port 3000:
   npm run dev

3. Database was recreated with new schema - all previous data is reset
